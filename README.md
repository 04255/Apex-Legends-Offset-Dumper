Not much to say just a Apex Legends Offsets + Netvar Dumper, it should survive some game updates and also it gave to you almost all you need to update your cheat.

Requeriments:

Go to your Apex Legends folder and rename r5apex.exe to EasyAntiCheat_launcher.exe, i recommend you do a backup of r5apex.exe and EasyAntiCheat_launcher.exe before doing this.

Maybe in the future ill add driver read to avoid this this requeriment, but meanwhile this is enough.

TO-DO
Add Kernel Mode RMP.
Improve netvar dumper formating?
